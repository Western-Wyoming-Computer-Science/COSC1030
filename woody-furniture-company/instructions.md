The Woody furniture company sells the following three styles of chairs:

| Style                  | Price Per Chair |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| American Colonial      | $ 85.00         |
| Modern                 | $ 57.50         |
| French Classical       | $127.75         |

Write a program that will input the amount of chairs sold for each style. It will print the total dollar sales of each style as well as the total sales of all chairs in fixed point notation with two decimal places.

# Instructions  

Compile the program. You should get no syntax errors.

Run the program. You should now see the first of several run time errors. There was no syntax or grammatical error in the program; however, just like commanding someone to break a law of nature, the program is asking the computer to break a law of math by dividing by zero. It cannot be done. On some installations, you may see this as output that looks very strange. 

Correct this program by having the code divide by 2 instead of 0. Re-compile and run the program. Type 9 when asked for input. Run the program using different values.

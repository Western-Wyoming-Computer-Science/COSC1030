# Instructions  

Compile the program. Here we have our first example of the many syntax errors that you no doubt will encounter in this course. The error message you receive may be different depending on the system you are using, but the compiler insists that a semicolon is missing somewhere.
Unfortunately, where the message indicates that the problem exists, and where the problem actually occurs may be two different places. To correct the problem place a semicolon after the line cout << "Today is a great day for Lab".

Most syntax errors are not as easy to spot and correct as this one. Re-compile the program and when you have no syntax errors,  run the program and input 9 when asked. Record the output. Try running it with different numbers.
